# group-coding

This is a group coding repository in which we'll add 5 codes daily.

# Announcement
We are going to start a group coding in which I'll post 5 leetcode questions daily from very basics to advance and if you are new in programming or you are thinking to get into, you can solve it.
You can post your code into comment section. All the code which will pass all the test cases correctly we will upload it into a GitHub repository per day.
And if you have any problem in any code you can discuss it into the comment section.
Note: you can use any programming language you know, here we are going to focus on logic more than to learn syntax.
In each night we will post the links of 5 problem statements for next day to solve.
IN THIS WAY, WE CAN IMPROVE OUR CODING SKILLS TOGETHER.
Let me know in the comment section if you are interested in it.
Thank you!!
